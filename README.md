# Rainmeter Skin

Minimal and functional Rainmeter skins that i use designed with a clean aesthetic.

The skin has been tested on a 2880x1800 display and so skins may be misaligned:

## Credits

- **Media Player**: The design and logic for the Player skin were taken from another suite, though the original source is unfortunately forgotten.
- **WebNowPlaying**: Required for the Player skin functionality.
- **CatCafe Font**: Used across various skins for a consistent, cute aesthetic.

## Installation
